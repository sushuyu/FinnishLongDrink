  <description>The Long Drink — or *lonkero*, as we call it in Finland — was first created in 1952 to welcome visitors attending the Summer Games in Helsinki. Commissioned by the Finnish government, the beverage company Hartwall developed this pre-mixed, ready-to-drink cocktail to help bars serve guests more efficiently. What began as a practical solution quickly became a national favorite. Today, the Finnish Long Drink stands as one of Finland’s most iconic beverages. Torille!</description>
